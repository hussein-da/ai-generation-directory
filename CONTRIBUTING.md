## Contribution Guidelines

### Before Adding a New Tool

- Ensure the tool is directly related to Generative AI
- Verify that the tool is actively maintained (as of 2024-2025)
- Check that the tool isn't already on the list (use GitHub's search functionality)
- Consider if the tool provides unique value compared to existing entries

When adding a new tool, please follow this format:

```markdown
**Tool Name** – [Link](https://link-to-tool) – Pricing (Free/Freemium/Paid/OSS)  
Short: Brief 1-2 line description of what the tool does and its unique features.
```

Example:

**Midjourney** – [Link](https://midjourney.com/) – Paid  
Short: High-quality, artistic text-to-image via Discord bot or web app.
